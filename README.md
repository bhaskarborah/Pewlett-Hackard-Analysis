# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview of Project

Pewlett-Hackard is a large company boasting thousands of employees. It has been around a long time and eventually people have started to retire.
The company would need to offer retirement packages to the retiring employees. It would also have to figure out how many new positions would open up due to the people retiring.
Bobby is an up and coming HR analyst. He has been assigned to find two answers on the below questions using employee analysis:
1. How many people are eligible for retirement packages?
2. How many positions will Pewllet-Hackard be required to fill in the near future?

## Purpose

All the data which is required to do the analysis for this project is present in six CSV files. We would have to build a employee database using Data Modeling, Engineering and Analysis skills.
This database and SQLs would be used in the project to provide the required answers to Pewlett-Hackard so that they can handle the retirement of employees in the most feasible manner.

The questions which require to be answered are:
1. How many people are eligible for retirement packages?
2. How many positions will Pewllet-Hackard be required to fill in the near future?

The deliverables from this project are:
Deliverable 1: The Number of Retiring Employees by Title
Deliverable 2: The Employees Eligible for the Mentorship Program
Deliverable 3: A written report on the employee database analysis (README.md)

(b) Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?

Unfortunately, the number of qualified, retirement-ready employees to mentor the next generation of Pewlett-Hackard employees does not seem to be adequate when compared to number of employees retiring. These eligible employee count is 1549.

The company might need to revise their eligibility criteria so that they can get more employees to mentor the next generation of Pewlett-Hackard employees.
